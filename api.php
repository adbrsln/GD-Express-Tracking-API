/*  GD Express (GDEX) Tracking API created by Afif Zafri.
    Tracking details are fetched directly from GDEX tracking website,
    parse the content, and return JSON formatted string.
    Please note that this is not the official API, this is actually just a "hack",
    or workaround for implementing tracking feature in other project.
    Usage: http://site.com/api.php?trackingNo=CODE , where CODE is your tracking number
